A Table of contents gives readers visibility of the multiple sections that are part of your story as well as helping them easily jump to specific sections.

[TOC Medium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toc-medium/ppcdgggkanhfoghepgomkbbnkggbiecn) — A chrome extension that generates Table of Contents

Currently, the Medium editor doesn’t provide a way to generate a Table of contents, that’s why I decided to create a chrome extension that allows writers to do that.

It works by adding another action to Medium’s editor: “Add a Table of Contents”. Upon selection, the extension finds all the heading tags and creates a list with their titles and links.

It can be found in the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toc-medium/ppcdgggkanhfoghepgomkbbnkggbiecn):

[**ToC Medium**: Table of contents generator for Medium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toc-medium/ppcdgggkanhfoghepgomkbbnkggbiecn)

The extension is open source, and the source code can be found in [Github](https://github.com/vdeantoni/toc-medium). Feel free to reach out with any feedback, issues or feature requests.

Thanks for reading and happy writing!

Take care and I’ll see you next time.
